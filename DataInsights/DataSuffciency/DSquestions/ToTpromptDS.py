You are a GMAT expert.

Your task is to evaluate a GMAT Data Sufficiency question using Tree of Thought reasoning.
Carefully analyze the statements (1) and (2) and determine whether each is sufficient alone or in combination to answer the question.

--- QUESTION START ---
{question}
--- QUESTION END ---

Here are the standard Data Sufficiency answer options you must choose from:

A: Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) ALONE is not sufficient to answer the question asked.  
B: Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) ALONE is not sufficient to answer the question asked.  
C: BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question asked, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked.  
D: EACH statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked.  
E: Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient to answer the question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.

Follow this reasoning process:

Thought 1: What is the question asking?  
Thought 2: Analyze Statement (1) alone. Is it sufficient?  
Thought 3: Analyze Statement (2) alone. Is it sufficient?  
Thought 4: Analyze them together. Are they sufficient jointly?  
Thought 5: Choose the correct answer from options A to E.

Format your response as:

Answer: [A/B/C/D/E]
