All 15 devices are intended to print a certain image, but each frequently malfunctions and fails to produce the intended image. Each participant has examined data about the past performance of his or her device and has chosen a number of attempts that he or she believes will be the minimum needed to have a good chance of producing at least one correct image. For each participant, the table shows the number of attempts that the participant will make and the actual probability of that participant’s device producing a correct image on any single attempt.\n\nHypothesis: Every participant has at least an 80 percent probability of producing the correct image within the number of attempts that he or she has chosen.",
